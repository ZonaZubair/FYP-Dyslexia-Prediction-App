# 🧠 Image Classification and Dyslexia Detection Web Application

## 📌 Overview
This project integrates **AI-based image classification** with an **interactive web game** designed to predict cognitive response patterns related to dyslexia.  
It compares three approaches, **Deep Learning (CNN)**, **Classical Machine Learning**, and **Transfer Learning (VGG16)**, to classify images into three categories: **Normal**, **Correlated**, and **Reversal**.  

The web interface provides an engaging, quiz-based experience for users while displaying real-time results and feedback.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **AI Models Comparison:**  
  Evaluates CNN, ML ensemble, and Transfer Learning (VGG16) models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- **Interactive Frontend:**  
  Offers two quiz modes, *Alphabetical Quiz* and *Word Quiz*, with random questions and dynamic scoring.  
- **Real-time Evaluation:**  
  Predicts the user’s category (*Normal*, *Correlated*, or *Reversal*) based on performance.  
- **Graphical Feedback:**  
  Displays detailed results with percentage scores and class-wise ratio charts.  
- **User Feedback Form:**  
  Allows participants to share responses after completion.
